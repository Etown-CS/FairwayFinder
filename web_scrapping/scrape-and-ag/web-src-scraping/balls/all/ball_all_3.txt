Golf balls can have a big impact on your game, and golfers have understood this for over a century now. The reason golf balls today are dimpled is that 19th
century golfers realized that beat up balls produced better and more consistent fight paths compared to perfectly smooth balls.
Today, the game is light years away from golfers having to beat up brand new balls to gain beter performance. Manufacturers have spent a lot of time and money
over the last century In order to better understand the science behind ball fight, compression, spin. and the materials used in manufacturing golf balls.
The result is that we now have a wide array of balls to choose from, with different types of balls excelling in different aspects of shot control and desired
performance.
Distance golf balls will provide you with long and superior distance on all shots and are suitable for any golfer who wants to gain distance.
For golfers with slower swing speeds, low compression golf balls create a high launch and low spin golf shot, which will nelp provide distance on shots as well as
reduce slicing or hooking that can happen when a shot has too much spin. Another option for golfers with slow to moderate swing speeds is performance distance
golf balls, which wil create explosive distance on drives but will still have a very playable feel on green-side shots.
For experienced golfers and those with high swing speeds, high performance golf balls wil blend distance and feel off the golf club. These balls will generate less
spin than the high performance spin golf balls, which translates to further distance. On the other hand, high performance spin golf balls also blend distance and
feel off the golf club, but they generate more spin on shots compared to the high performance balls, which will lead to enhanced feel and control on all golf shots.
GlobalGolf.com is proud to cary bal from top manufacturers like Titleist golf balls (including their renowned Pro V1 golf balls).
