ENHANCE YOUR SHORT GAME WITH THE RIGHT GOLF WEDGES
The closer you get to the green, the more precise you need to be. Keeping the right wedges in your bag will help
produce the loft and roll you're looking for on each approach. At TGW, we sell all types of golf wedges, including
pitching wedges, gap wedges, sand wedges and lob wedges. Use the TGW Golf Wedge Guide to learn more
about each wedge design and why they are important to have in your bag
Everyone's preferences are different, so we carry dozens of clubs from the leading wedge brands. You'll find
discounted prices on TaylorMade, Callaway, Ping, Cleveland and others known for producing great clubs. We have
wedges for men and women plus plenty of left-handed wedges for the southpaws. Use our filters to search based
on loft angle, bounce angle and other factors that affect how a wedge performs. The TGW team can answer any,
questions — call, email or text us seven days a week.
