Golf wedges have a tendency to get overlooked more than any other club in the bag. But did you know that about seventy percent of your shots on the golf cours
can be attributed to the short game? That is why you should take a closer 100k in your golf bag at these humble worknorse clubs and see if a new club might help
improve your short game.
When shopping for new wedges, there are a few things to keep in mind:
What is bounce?
Bounce is the angle from the leading edge to the bottom (trailing edge) of the sole. The higher this angle is, the easier the club will bounce off of the ground (rathe
than dig into the turf), which is good for chip shots around the green.
How many clubs shoud I carry and how do you determine the gaps between their lofts?
‘The USGA mandates that golfers may carry at most 14 clubs. If you can carry three wedges, we recommend a 52° viedge, a 56° wedge, and a 60° wedge. This
creates four degrees of difference in loft between each club. If you can only carry two wedges, we recommend a 54° wedge and a 58° wedge. It is beneficial to bu
wedges that create equal loft differences between clubs because this will allow you to execute shots on a more consistent basis.
‘The most common wedge loft is 56°, but here at Global Golf, we carry wedges with lofts ranging from 42° all the way through 64°.
GlobalGolf.com is also proud to offer a wide variety of new and used golf wedges, available in a full range of degrees from a all of the game's leading
manufacturers, including Cleveland wedges, Titleist (Vokey) wedges, Taylormade wedges, and more. Our inventory changes on a daily basis, So check back often
for our most current inventory of products.
