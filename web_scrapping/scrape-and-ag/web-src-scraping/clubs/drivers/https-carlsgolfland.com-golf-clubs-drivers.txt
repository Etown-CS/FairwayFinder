most out of your drives. There are subtle variations for every player, but the general rule is @ golfer with a higher swing speed should use &
stifer shaft.

2. Use the right loft for your drive. If you find that your drives are consistently higher then you would like, & golf driver with lower loft would
be best for you. If your drives are lower than you would like, try a higher loft.

3. When in doubt, test it out. If you aren't sure which driver is best for you, then don't be afraid to try out several clubs before you buy. In our
famous Launch Pad Fitting Center, you can test the golf drivers for sale in our stores to find the optimal balance of size, flexibility, and loft
