YOUR DRIVER SHOULD FIT YOUR PLAYING STYLE

Like all golf clubs, a driver must fit properly to allow you to play your best game. If your new golf driver doesn't fit your size or playing style,

then your drives will never be as strong as they should be. Here are a few simple tips to make sure that you buy the best club for yous

1. Get the proper stiffness shaft for your playing style. Depending on your swing type, you might need a flexible or very stiff shaft to get the,
most out of your drives. There are subtle variations for every player, but the general rule is a golfer with a higher swing speed should use
stifer shaft.

2. Use the right loft for your drive. If you find that your drives are consistently higher then you would like, & golf driver with lower loft would
be best for you. If your drives are lower then you would lie, try a higher loft.

3. When in doubt, test it out. If you aren't sure which driver is best for you, then don't be afraid to try out several clubs before you buy. In our
femous Launch Ped Fitting Center, you can test the golf drivers for sale in our stores to find the optimal balance of size, flexibility, and loft
before your make & purchase.
