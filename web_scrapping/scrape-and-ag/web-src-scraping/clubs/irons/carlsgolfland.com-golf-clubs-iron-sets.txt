HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT IRON SETS
As the name implies, golf iron sets are made up of several different clubs, often including 6, 7, or 8 pieces. Modern irons can be a complicated
business, but shopping at Carl's Golfland makes the buying experience as easy as possible. We have a great selection of golf irons for sale at
the guaranteed lowest prices, with a variety of customizable sets to fit your unique needs.
FIND THE RIGHT GOLF IRONS FOR YOUR GAME
Choosing the right irons set doesn't mean choosing a specific brand or picking a 2 fron over a 5 iron. There are multiple types of golf irons
available, but we'll look at two: player irons and game improvement irons.
+ Player Irons are the least forgiving but provide the best response, trajectory, and carry distance for skilled golfers. Professional players and
‘golfers with exceptionally low handicaps should be using player irons to get the best results.
+ Game Improvement Irons (or Super Game Improvement irons) are designed to be much more forgiving. For players with mid to high
handicaps, a set of game improvement irons will produce much better results and a lower overall score each round than player irons would.
Pay attention to your handicap when choosing an iron set. Using clubs that match your skill level will allow you to continually play at your best
and improve over time. You may also want to consider driving and utility irons to replace long irons or hybrids if you're a player with a fast
swing looking for more distance and greater accuracy. These clubs are sold individually.
When choosing golf irons, you slso want to choose the correct shaft flex for your playing style. If you have a low handicap and @ very high
swing speed, using a stiffer shaft will let you maximize the power and accuracy of each swing. For players with higher handicaps and lower
swing speeds, a golf iron set with a more flexible shaft will allow you to develop greater force in your swing and give you better distance. We
carry customizable iron sets from brands ike Mizuno, PING, and Callaway, giving you a wide range of options to choose from.
