### Project Description
FairwayFinder is a unique website that allows users to search for golf gear pricing across multiple online stores. Using backend web scraping, database management, and site deployment, we have made a effective and easy to use website. Our website gives users filtering options to refine their searches. The website also provides FairwayFinder is a genuinely useful tool for anyone who is looking for the best deals without the headache of navigating multiple websites.

### Setup Instructions
This project can be used in its final released form [here.](https://fairway-finder.vercel.app/)
However, if you would like to set up a local test environment(frontend only), you can follow these steps:
- clone this repository to the desired location
- open a terminal and navigate to the client folder
- run ```npm install```, ```npm update```, then ```npm run dev```
- navigate to the localhost page specified by the output in your terminal

### How to Use
Using this software is very easy, even to a new user. When you first load the page, you can navigate to multiple different pages using the navigation bar at the top, or you can search for a category of equipment using the search bar presented to you on the homepage. To search for the best deals on golf gear you can type what you are looking for into the search box.

Then click the "Go to Golf Deals" button. Then you will be brought to a search results page. On the right you will see product results from across multiple mainstream golf gear stores. On the left is a panel where you can filter and refine your search results. You can look for specific brands, limit to a single category, choose a price range, list results low to high, and vice versa.

All search results have the products price, brand name, and a link to the seller's website. Once you go to the website you can compare the prices FairwayFinder pulls to the real price. This is because sometimes we get incorrect results due to our data pipeline using Optical Character Recognition and Generative AI
