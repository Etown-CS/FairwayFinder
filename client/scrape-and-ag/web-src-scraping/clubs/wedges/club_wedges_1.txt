ENHANCE YOUR SHORT GAME WITH THE RIGHT GOLF WEDGES
Golf wedges are essential in helping you with your short game. Golfers of all skill levels can enjoy the complexities
of the golf wedge designed for short approach shots, bunker shots, pitches and chip shots. When precision is key
in short-range situations, the golf wedge is vital and is a must-have for any golfers bag.
TYPES OF GOLF WEDGES
« Pitching Wedges: Pitching wedges are the most common wedge and are typically included in a golfers iron
set. They have a loft angle of around 44-48 degrees and are used for approach shots from around 100-130
yards away from the green. They are also great for chipping around the green when you want the ball to roll
out more.
+ Gap Wedges: Gap wedges, also known as attack or approach wedges, have a loft angle of around 50-54
degrees. They are designed to fil the gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, hence the name.
This wedge is great for approach shots from around 80-100 yards away from the green. It can also be used
for chipping around the green when you want more height and less roll
+ Sand Wedges: Sand wedges, as the name suggests, are primarily used for bunker shots and getting out of
trouble in the sand. They have a loft angle of around 54-58 degrees and have a wide sole that helps the club
glide through the sand. They can also be used for approach shots from around 70-80 yards away from the
green
+ Lob Wedges:Lob wedges, also known as flop wedges, have a loft angle of around 60-64 degrees. They are
used for shots that require a high trajectory and minimal roll. These shots are usually from around 50 yards or
less from the green. They can also be used for getting out of deep bunkers or thick rough
