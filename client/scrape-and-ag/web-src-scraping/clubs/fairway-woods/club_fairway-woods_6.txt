FIND THE RIGHT FAIRWAY WOODS FOR YOUR GAME
If you want to play st your highest level, you need to have at least one wellitted fairway wood in your bag. Golf woods are made to fil the
distance gap between a driver and an fron, allowing your swings on the fairway to be at just the right distance to place the ball on the green.
Lower your scores with a great fairway wood from Carl's Golfland todsy!
We carry a huge selection of fairway woods to keep you playing at your best! Our clubs come from the best names in goff lke Cobra,
TeylorMade, Titleist, and Ping, to make sure that you get the quality gear you deserve. We also have the lowest prices in the industry, and even
offer free shipping on our clubs to get you the best gear at a price you can't refuse. And best of al, if you find out that the golf fainay woods
you ordered don't fit correctly, you can return them unused to us within 30 days and receive 100% of your money back.
HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT GOLF WOOD
Fairway woods come in multiple different lofts, with each designed to give you optimum distance at different ranges from the ole. Lofts with
lower numbers give you more distance, while higher lofts give you less. Which you choose depends on the situation you're facing on the
course. A 3 wood provides longer distance, so it's great for the 2° swing on a par 5, or it can even be used as your driver on a par 3. A5 or 7
wood, on the other hand, excels at approach shots where you want to avoid overshooting the green. When buying a new golf wood, our
advice s to match the club to what situstions you'll most often face on the course. And remember that many golfers choose to carry multiple
different fairway woods with them in their bag, so they have the best club for the shot.
When purchasing & new golf fairway wood, you'l also want to make sure that the shaft's flexibility matches your playing style. The rules for
flexibility match those for drivers: if you're a skiled golfer with a very high swing speed, you fikely need a stiffer shaft. If you are more of a
workcin-progress golfer with a lower swing speed, a more flexible shaft is much more ikely to deliver accurate and powerful swings. The
following is lst of what stiffness you should use based on your average drive distance:
+ Less than 180 yards (165 meters), use ladies flex.
+ Between 181 to 200 yards (166 to 183 meters), use senior flex.
+ Between 200 to 235 yards (183 to 215 meters), use regular flex.
+ Between 236 to 275 yards (216 to 251 meters), use stiff flex.
+ More than 275 yards (251 meters), use extra-stf flex.
